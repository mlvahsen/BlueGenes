fresh_1,1 to 2,10.3,10.3,10.2,,,,"Freshwater measurement types: for (1 to 2, 2 to 3, 3 to 4) a dry 2x6 was laid across the two aluminum bars for the higher level. Then a ruler was used to make the measurement to the bottom of the board to the front piece of aluminum (ie one closest to the next lowest level). for (4 to 5 and 5 to 6) an adjustable square was used. the side parallel to the ground was rested on the front bar for the higher level. the ruler was then placed directly onto the back bar of the aluminum shelf of the level down. (for these two rows, the measurements were made the square underwater (so take some caution). "

However, if the two bars for the same shelf were not level, then the block of wood was rested on the front bar of the higher shelf, leveled (with a blullet level) and the delta difference was made using an adjustable square. In those same cases, shelves that had two bars of different heights, the delta from above was measured first to the front bar and then the back bar, so we can take the average height the pot likely sat at that shelf. Finally, for (5 to 6) an adjustable square was used. the side parallel to the ground was rested on the front bar for the higher level. the ruler was then placed directly onto the back bar of the aluminum shelf of the level down. (for these two rows, the measurements were made the square underwater (so take some caution). "
